My name is Xiaomeng Li. I will join the Department of Modern and Classical Languages at Western Washington University in 2023 fall. My research focuses on second language reading and language assessment. I am particularly interested in how cross-linguistic variations in writing systems affect reading development, as well as how language assessments measure, predict, and improve students' language learning process.
